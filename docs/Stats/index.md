fig**share** statistics service
===============================

The fig**share** statistics service is available at https://stats.figshare.com and
it supports retrieving information about the number of *views*, *downloads* and *shares*
related to items available of fig**share**. From here on, an event is one of *view*,
*download* or *share*.

All communication with the service is done through *https* and all data is encoded as *json*.
Optional authorization for specific endpoints is done through basic access authentication.

* [Authentication](#authentication)
* [Errors](#errors)
* [Endpoints](#endpoints)


## Authentication

For some specialized endpoints, access to institution specific statistics requires
sending a `base64`-encoded pair of `username:password` in the basic authorization header:

```http
GET https://stats.figshare.com/lboro/top/views/article
Authorization: Basic dGhpcyBpcyBub3QgdGhlIHJlYWwgcGFzc3dvcmQsIGZvb2wh
```

Please note that the analogous endpoint for retrieving statistics for items outside
the institutional scope, requires no authentication:
```http
GET https://stats.figshare.com/top/views/article
```
